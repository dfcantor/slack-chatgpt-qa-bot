This is what mak es \nthe ABS data model unique in contrast to other approaches  \nusing more than one data model for different parts of the \ncore insurance processes.\u2022There is only one way to store information. Person da ta is \ncaptured only once and used in LoBs (Line of Business) in \nexactly the same way (other approaches capture person data \nin a LoB-specific way which leads to redundancies). The data  \nmodel supports multiple lines of business (LoBs) in a uniform \nway.\n\u2022There is also only one way how a person is described fr om \na data perspective, regardless of the role in the business \nprocess, be it a policy holder, a business partner or a medica l \ndoctor performing an expert opinion. This characteristic \nenables a 360-degree customer view.\n\u00a0\nThe data model provides means for functional historicizat ion (which information was valid at a certain point in time) and revision/audit \nhistoricization (which user captured what information and when).\nMulti-language, multi-currency and multi-tenant functionalities are sup ported.\n\uf0a4 Logical and physical data model\nThe ABS data model is set-up as logical and physical mode l.

Defining data is maintained via the ABS Configurat ion \nSuite application.\nOperational data , as its name suggests, is the data of insurance \nbusiness's day-to-day operations.

Furthermore, \nthe reason for amendment defines the further process.\u00a0\n\u2022Having contracts reasons for amendment allows amendment s to be desribed quite exactly. This detailed description is of great \nimportance when amending a contract.\n\u2022The selected reason for amendment also defines how the  amendment is executed and processed in ABS Core, i.e. by m eans of an \namendment application, amendment notice or direct contract amendment.\n\u2022The selected reason also influences which data can be modi fied in the user interface.\n\u2022Based on the type of amendment, the transactions that ch ange the contract, as well as the handling options, are cle arly described.\n\u2022Moreover, this serves the purpose of documenting the transact ions and changes within the history of a given contract.\n\uf0ebAs an example, an amendment could be a change in payment fre quency and a change in collection \ntype. Under this scenario, the clerk manually selects the co ntract\u00a0reason for amendment G14 \u2013 \nnon-technical change. Based on the changed payment frequency, A BS automatically sets the \nfirst reason as G35 \u2013 change of payment frequency. If the collect ion type has been changed as \nwell, the second reason change of collection address or col lection type is also automatically set.\nThe executed amendment and therefore the reason for \namendment are also documented on the resulting policy \ndocument.

The amendment becomes effective after policy processing.\nChange of ownership (G65):\u00a0\nWhen a contract is transferred to another policy holder, it is deemed a change of ownership. The current contract sta ge is \nvalid with the same conditions for the remainder of th e contract period for the new owner. In the event that t he transfer of \nthe contract also contains a modification of the expiratio n date or the product generation, this leads to contract co nversion.\nConversion (G76):\u00a0\nA conversion results in a new contract, based on an exist ing \ncontract. In other words, the new contract replaces the prev ious \none. Duration, period of cancelation, etc. are reinitialized and start \nover. It is mandatory to change to the new product generat ion.\u00a0\nABS also supports indirect conversion. This occurs if the \nexpiration date is longer than two years in the future a nd \nmore than eleven months ahead of the expiration date \nin the original contract. This case is also considered a \nconversion and is based on the rules of reason for amend ment \nG76. However, eventually the bundle product and the \ncoverage need to be updated to the actual class products.Suspension (G64):\nA contract can be temporarily suspended or retired. In this  \ncase, the contract remains \u201calive,\u201d but during the suspension, \nthe customer is not required to pay the premiums and the \ninsurance company does not need to pay any benefits.\u00a0\nIn sum, there is no insurance \ncoverage under a suspended contract.\nContract Amendment (G80):\u00a0\nTechnically, a copy of the contract is created in the \nform of a quote when the contract is amended (e.g. \nchange of the sum insured or of a product component, \ninclusion/exclusion of a specific class, amendment of \nan object). This copy, however, is not a new application; \nall data of the existing contract is transferred, but \nswitching to a new product generation is not mandatory.Free of Premium (G17):\u00a0\nIn this case, the policy holder is exempt from premium \npayments for a defined period. Nevertheless, the contract \nremains valid and in force. In contrast to suspension, unde r \nfree of premium, insurance coverage is still provided.\nReactivation (G02):\u00a0\nThis means the reinstatement of previously suspended \nor canceled contracts based on existing insurance terms.Non-Recurring Settlement:\u00a0\nThis refers to when credit items or receivables are tem porarily \nbooked on the contract account, for example premium \ntransfer, profit shares or short-term additional coverage .", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2795, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f7b47d6-48c0-402c-9d21-1d8c99144c52": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f7b47d6-48c0-402c-9d21-1d8c99144c52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "ABS_Prof_Full.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "87cc2fd7-8396-4514-8b60-7c3e34d0db93", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "ABS_Prof_Full.pdf"}, "hash": "b7125c7a1ac4ae40df2e15ad4d48d03d092959e7f1f6ffae6005abbf50e5202d"}}, "hash": "b7125c7a1ac4ae40df2e15ad4d48d03d092959e7f1f6ffae6005abbf50e5202d", "text": "Contract cancellations are also done via a \ntechnical reason for amendment and can be \nclassified in three types:1.Complete Cancelation (G08):  in this case, all non-canceled \nclasses are now canceled, resulting in the policy holder \nno longer having any coverage based on the contract in \nquestion.

In this case, a scheduled task for future \ncancelation is triggered either manually by the user or bas ed \non a functional trigger in batch.

His old car was a total loss so he bought a new one. Conrad \ncalls his Allianz account manager to inform him that he h as a new car and \nwishes to continue to insure it with Allianz. Conrad wa nts to cancel the old \ncontract since his previous vehicle no longer exists. Conra d wants to keep \nhis insurance as it is, without changing the insurance sums.\nConrad Smith\u2019s Allianz account manager is able to fulfill t hese two requirements in a single work step.  Canceling the old contract and \ninsuring the new car in one go is called surrogate contract.\n\uf02dSurrogate contract means that a new contract replaces one or mor e existing ones.\nIn other words, an existing contract is replaced by a new application based on the selection of the corresponding reas on for \namendment. Alternatively, an existing contract is canceled  due to a new application. Furthermore, the transfer of class es from an \nexisting contract to a new one, or the cancelation of an e xisting class by a contract, is also deemed surrogate busines s.\u00a0\nSurrogate contract can be triggered by a conversion, vehicle cha nge, change of ownership or a new application, among others.\nFour options for surrogate contract in ABS:\n\u2022Option 1:  manual entry of policy numbers to be canceled (surrogate thro ugh cancelation)\n\u2022Option 2:  manual documentation through the use of contract relations\n\u2022Option 3:  use of special core reasons for amendment\n\u2022Option 4:  surrogate contract on class level\n1. Manual entry of policy numbers to be canceled\nThe first option for triggering the execution of surrogate cont ract \nin post-processing is to manually enter one or more indi vidual \npolicy numbers of existing contracts in the side-tab activity  control. \nDuring the application\u2019s policy processing, the existing contract  \nis canceled, and whether or not any open balances are to be \ntransferred to the surrogate contract is customizable.2. Manual documentation through the use of contract relation\nThis option is based entirely on user documentation, since  in this \ncase, ABS cannot trigger surrogate contract automatically. As s uch, \nthe clerk manually cancels the former contract and creates a new \none. In creating the new application, the clerk documents surr ogate \nbusiness based on the creation of contract relations. As me ntioned, \nABS does not apply any functional checks or other automated  \nprocess on such an operation.\n3. Use of special core reasons for amendment\nIt is also possible to trigger surrogate contract\u00a0 by selectin g the \nappropriate reason for amendment. Any reason of amendment  \nstarting with G1 (e.g. G1W, G1T) causes automatically the \ncancelation of the old contract and results in surrogate con tract. If \nthe product on which the former contract\u00a0was based is no lo nger \nvalid, then the conversion process mandatorily requires a bundle/4. Surrogate contract on class level\nIn addition to replacing a former with a successor contract, ABS \nalso allows the triggering of surrogate business\u00a0 at class le vel. \nThis process is initiated by selecting the corresponding re ason \nfor amendment, which results in the possibility of selectin g the \nas yet non-canceled classes for transfer to a new contract , and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3399, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91079a8b-0f76-41d7-86ed-b61edc49b8f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "91079a8b-0f76-41d7-86ed-b61edc49b8f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "ABS_Prof_Full.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30b91274-7180-45fc-b0d4-816b02ef294d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "ABS_Prof_Full.pdf"}, "hash": "ab0d86b54e4310286dcd58d3f5416106fdf8b43e006224adfca17afcba876515"}}, "hash": "ab0d86b54e4310286dcd58d3f5416106fdf8b43e006224adfca17afcba876515", "text": "product change.

This is one of the reasons why this attribute is not  persisted back to the \ndatabase.\nDescribe the tasks which are performed when processing non-recurring settlements.\n1.

Commissioning, subledger accounting\n6. DB update and print\nExplain the possibilities which exist to check consistency and functional correctness before an application is post-processed.\nThe first overall step in post-processing is checking applicati ons and applications for amendment for functional correctness  and \nconsistency.\u00a0\nSeveral checks in the client are already executed at the  quote stage. Checks are also performed at the contract sta ge before post-\nprocessing if the business process status is set to complete/pe nding. These checks are of a functional and technical nature. C ertain \ntechnical checks can correct errors or mistakes in data en tered based on functional rules. Furthermore, the usage of som e technical \ncorrection checks is customizable, in the sense that customer s enable or disable them. Others are mandatory and cann ot be disabled.\nDescribe the process of the actual policy-processing, starting with the primary task, which selects the relevant business objects for \npolicy-processing.\n1. Select relevant business object or application with busines s process status \"complete\" - business objects or applications without \noutstanding process slips and which have passed consistency checks are forwarded for policy processing.\n2. Lock all selected applications and their corresponding cont racts from being changed.\n3. Calculation of premiums (prorated calculation) - if necessar y, forward or backward projection is calculated.\n4. Calculation of agent\u00b4s commission, rating or appraisal of t he forward or backward projection is executed (control modul es for \ncustomer-specific calculation); commission bookings are processed  in the subledger accounting step.\n5. The policy printing step consists of collecting the policy da ta and printing the policy data and is highly customer-speci fic\na. Collecting the policy data: necessary information to be prin ted on the policy document is amassed. Customer-specific value s \ncan be defined. The content of these data fields are mostl y collected by customer-specific sub-programs or automated routine s \nthat persist the information in certain tables.\nb. Printing the policy data causes the interpretation of the format for the collected information. For this task, most ABS Core \ncustomers have their own sub-program or automated routine, w hich communicate with ABS via an interface. The interpreted  and \nformatted information is provided as character strings an d stored as individual files.\n6. Subledger accounting task: this takes the results of the pro rated calculations and the commissioning and appraisal and  \nreinsurance, and persists them in the ABS database to ex ecute the necessary bookings. If the customer has a customer a ccount, \nthe calculated premium for the contract account gets rebooked to  the customer account.\n7. Database update: necessary information is persisted in t he ABS database.

Most of the checks can be done automatically by \nthe system.\nOn the top-tab coverage all information about the coverage \nverification with respect to reason, amount and scope is sh own.\n\uf0eb We return to Conrad Smith\u2019s rear-end collision with T imothy Barnes\u2019s car. Finally, all incident reports \nfrom Conrad, Timothy and from the witness have arrived . Now that all the information is available, \nthe claim clerk can begin the next step, which is to check th e coverage and liability regarding the \nclaim\u2019s justification.\n\uf0a4 Reason-Based Coverage Verification\nFirst, the insurance coverage needs to be calculated. This is  called reason-based coverage verification.\nInsurance coverage (reason based coverage verification) is calculated based  on four checks:\n1. Contractual coverage check\nRefers to the question \"Is the loss event covered by th is contract?\" \nThis check can be done manually by the clerk by comparing the \nclaim event (combination class/loss type/loss cause) with the \ncoverages and coverage items available on the contract.\nE.g if loss type is \"Vandalism\", then contractual coverage ex ists if \nthe coverage item for Vandalism is available on the cont ract. Note 2. Risk-based Coverage check\nIt is checked whether the risk-object is covered by the co ntract. \nDepending on the contract, this is either a vehicle (vehi cle \ninsurance), a person (accident, health, life insurance), or the  event \nplace (property insurance).\nBased on that the system shows one of the questions \" Is the vehicle \ncovered by this policy?\" or \"Is the person covered by this contract?\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2048, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5dc0db8-17a1-490a-b5f8-e8095fcd27bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5dc0db8-17a1-490a-b5f8-e8095fcd27bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "ABS_Prof_Full.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abb13bde-8e3e-4469-af4b-65ba521eaa58", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "ABS_Prof_Full.pdf"}, "hash": "9038d3921647b0a726ada692653e669eba630acfd47482acaf2418cb66a85aca"}}, "hash": "742ff6cf717ed766dd3980b9e7a5a1302ec7950890d726457a5415e40059cc13", "text": "that this check can be also done automatically by the syst em, see \nchapter \"Automatic Contractual Coverage verification\"\n3. Premium-based coverage check\nThis is done based on the contract information stored i n ABS. If no \npremium-based coverage exists, the clerk is informed of negat ive \npremium-based coverage. In this case, he or she can override  it with \na result of a manually executed check of premium-based coverage. \nThis is necessary because it can be that in certain cases co verage \nexists although the system did not find coverage. An exam ple would \nbe a policy which lost coverage because of non-payment. However  \nthe customer paid the outstanding premium today and on the  same \nday has a claim. Then the system did not process the pay ment yet \nand when notifying the claim the system does not find pr emium-\nbased coverage. Therefore a clerk can manually overwrite th e result \nin this case, if there is sufficient proof that the customer pa id the \npremium.or \"Is the loss event location covered by the contract?\". The check \ncan be done manually or automatically by the system.\n4. Coverage check at the damage level\nFor every instance of person or property damage. An example  \nwould be damage of small glasses. Glass damage could be covered  \nin general but on damage level coverage might not be existi ng \nbecause small glasses such as lights or mirrors are excluded . The \ncheck is always done manually.\nIn the ABS Rich Client, two top-tabs are related to the  coverage and liability verification. These are the  top-tab contract  and top-tab \ncoverage. \u00a0\nNote, that in the top-tab contract all the \ncontract data is shown such as coverages, \ninsured objects, insured risks, individual \nagreements, terms and conditions, and so \nforth.\nThe screenshot shows the tab coverage \nand contains also the relations to the \ndifferent types of coverage verification \nwith respect to the reason.\nIn addition to the four checks described above, a number of furt her criteria do exist which can influence the result of the  coverage \nverification with respect to the reason. In the screensho t these criteria are visible on the top of the screen.\n\u2022\"Did a neglection of duties occur?\"  This refers to a breach \nof obligations.

Does not impact the coverage verification wi th \nrespect to the reason.\u00a0\nFinally, the result of the reason based coverage verificati on can be seen in the field on the ABS Rich Client label ed \"Insurance \ncoverage\" (5). The value for the field is derived by the s ystem based on the outcome of the checks (1) \u2013 (4), and the  two fields for \nneglection of duties and whether fraud was involved.\n\uf0a4 Coverage and Liability Verification Concerning Extent (Amount and Scope)\nThe coverage and liability verifications ensure that the payment amount does not exceed the total coverage amount and that invoices \nare covered and are in scope.\u00a0\n\uf0eb Using the same scenario of Conrad Smith rear-ending Timo thy Barnes\u2019s car, we arrive at the point \nwhere the invoice for Timothy\u2019s damaged vehicle has arr ived at Allianz from the repair shop. The \nclaim clerk can now continue with the next step of the cove rage and liability check. This is to check \nthe coverage and/or liability concerning the extent, which means amount and scope.\nAt heart, the purpose of the coverage\u00a0verification concerning \nextent with regard to amount is to see if the contract\u00a0covers the \nclaim\u00a0amount. This cannot be performed until all documents \nare present, including especially invoices. The verification \nensures that the payment amount does not exceed the tot al \ncoverage\u00a0amount.\nThe purpose of the  coverage\u00a0verification concerning extent with \nregard to scope  is to ensure that individual invoices, payment \nrequests and the single position are all covered. It goes  without \nsaying that this cannot be performed until all documents ar e \npresent, including\u00a0invoices.\n\uf0ebAn example would be: We have received an invoice document co ntaining three\u00a0items, A, B, and C.\nFor every item there is an amount. 100 for A, 200 for B and 500 for position C. What is the difference between \nthe coverage verification for the amount and the scope?\n\u2022Verification for the amount: We look only at the amounts and verify if they are cove red according to the contract. So does the \ncontract grant coverage for the amount of 100 for type A, 200 for type B and 500 for type C?\n\u00a0\n\u2022Verification for the scope: We look at the different types and check if they are cover ed in the contract. In this example we have to \ncheck if the types A, B, and C are as such covered.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2745, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3c08e8b-ea7e-49a8-b840-e10f7705463a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3c08e8b-ea7e-49a8-b840-e10f7705463a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "ABS_Prof_Full.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3efd5312-a1df-4c3a-87b6-9db55b669251", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "ABS_Prof_Full.pdf"}, "hash": "0126a56bf6063aa076cc9c9f8b5a2bcc5109fbb1aff0921d11072270bd96483b"}}, "hash": "0126a56bf6063aa076cc9c9f8b5a2bcc5109fbb1aff0921d11072270bd96483b", "text": "The coverage check for the extent  is mostly a combination of \nboth amount and scope. So for example it can be that according \nto the contract there is coverage for up to 200 for type A, up to \n400 for type B, but only up to 300 for type C. Then position C  \nwould be only partially covered because the claimed amount fo r \ntype C is too high. Therefore the coverage result for the a mount \nand scope is only \"Partially existing\".Once these two checks are done, the  total verification of \ncoverage \u00a0can be confirmed in ABS. This is documented by the \nclerk in the field \"Effective coverage\" (see field (6)) abov e. Note \nthat this field consists of the combined result of both: The  result \nof the coverage verification with respect to the reason (fi eld (5)) \nplus the result of the coverage verification concerning the ex tent. \nFor this there is no separate field.\n\uf0a4 Liability Verification\nThe ABS Rich Client offers functionality for the verificatio n and documentation of liability. This means that the cle rk can document fault, \nor partial fault with fault-percentage values.\nThe information regarding the liability can only be enter ed if the \nrelated claims class is a liability class (e.g. a vehicle l iability, or \npersonal liability). So a class where the liability infor mation is \nnecessary.Information regarding any deductibles can be entered as a \npercentage, type, as well as gross and net amount, based on t he \ncontract, following payment calculation.\n\uf10dFinally, coverage and liability comments can be \nadded in the form of free text.\n\uf0a4 Automatic Contractual Coverage Verification\nThis chapter deals with the automatic contractual coverage v erification.

This could  be payment \nrequest, invoice, cost estimate or expert opinion (which wa s not assigned by Allianz). These assignment types will be created in ABS, \ncalculated (e.g. reduced by deductible) and finally paid out. This is the standard process in claims handling in an insuran ce company \nand that's why this category is called standard assignme nts.\nA standard assignment can be any one of the following:\n\u2022Cost estimates are used to document received external \ncost estimates that do not originate from Allianz busine ss \npartners, yet are used as a basis for calculation.\n\u2022Invoices are used to document received invoices that do n ot \noriginate from Allianz business partners, yet are used as a \nbasis for calculation and payments.\u2022An expert opinion is used to document received external \nexpert opinions that do not originate from Allianz busine ss \npartners, yet are used as a basis for calculation.\n\u2022Payment requests are used to document received payment \nrequested from a customer. These are then used as a \nbasis for a calculation. Examples can be material costs and \npersonal contributions.\nAll four types can be completely handled by a clerk and ther efore no outsourcing of the process or part of the process take s place. The \nprocess is anyway a very simple one in this case which i s just the capturing of the data on the invoice, cost estima te, expert opinion or \npayment request in ABS manually.\n\uf0a4 Inspection Assignments\n\u2022Inspection assignments are primarily used in claims. \nNevertheless, they can also be used in the Application \nprocess, e.g. for older cars. The inspection is performed by a \ncourt-certified vehicle expert who can be internal or exter nal.\n\u2022For all types of inspections, work lists determine the t eam \nleader\u2019s allocation of assignments as well as the proces sing \ndone by a team member.\n\u2022ABS deliberately avoids covering certain functions such as \nexpert opinion software for vehicles.

Someone from the claim field service for onsite  claim \nsettlement and inspection carries out these inspection as signments.

In the best case, the customer agrees to a l ump sum compensation package, which is also referred to as a m obile \nredemption or cash without repair.\u00a0The expert in this case  uses ABS in its offline version with data synchronizat ion to and from a \nhome office. This approach aims at achieving an onsite resol ution to a claim that consequently results in cost reductio ns through \nredemption processing and the partial replacement of extern al experts.\u00a0\nThis assignment type is used for two kinds of use cases: In  the first place for Claim field service. Claim field servi ce is a claim \nclerk onsite - not an expert.\u00a0If Allianz needs to assign  an expert or Claim field service determines that a qua lified expert opinion is \nnecessary expert opinion non-life will be used in ABS.

Restitutions usually start with a cost estimate and end  up with an invoice. \nThis type of assignment is for requesting a cost estimate from an external service provider such as a repair shop. AB S can also receive \nsuch estimates electronically via a portal connection.\nThere are two types of restitution:\nActive restitution\nWhereby the clerk proactively offers a partner service provi der to \nthe customer; cost estimate is created in the ABS Rich C lient, the \nbusiness partner receives the cost estimate via the porta l and the \nrestitution is carried out.Passive restitution\nIn which case the customer goes directly to the external business \npartner who creates the cost estimate in the portal and  the \nrestitution is carried out.\nEach restitution assignment\u00a0 (being a cost estimate) must be  \nchecked and approved. Along the way, an expert opinion or an  audit \ncan be requested\u00a0or none of them. This may depend on the amount \nof the cost estimate. If an expert opinion or audit is don e for the \ncost estimate, the expert inspects the damage on the vehi cle and \ncompares it to the cost estimate provided by the repairer . Based on \nthis, the expert either approves or declines the cost est imate.\nIf it is approved, the repair shop conducts the repair\u00a0and en ters the \ninvoice directly in ABS (via the portal). A new assignme nt is created \nfor this invoice. If the invoice amount is not bigger than t he cost \nestimate, the system will pay automatically the amount t o the repair \nshop. Otherwise, there is a process slip generated in orde r for the \nclerk to check the situation.\nIf the expert however declines the cost estimate in the  first place, \nthen there is the possibility for the repair shop to crea te a new cost \nestimate.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0The external partners which are involved in this type of \nassignment\u00a0are Allianz partner service providers. They n eed to fulfill \ncertain quality criteria\u00a0such as service levels and offerin g special \nservices to the customer such as car cleaning or replacement car \nduring the duration of the repair.

The redemption amount is entered and the system calculates a utomatically the \nredemption difference by using the amount from the costing basi s. An example would be a cost estimate of 5.000 for repair o f a house \nafter a water damage. Instead of paying now the amount of 5 .000\u20ac, Allianz can offer a redemption of e.g. 2.500\u20ac to the cust omer.

The claim process slip has a special function \nfor generating generic process slips.

The relation can be experienced on the con tract account balance when using the button \u201ccommission\u201d. The \nfollowing menu displays all commission transactions linke d to the selected premium booking.\n\u2022The relation rebooking links two rebooked bookings.

Th is relation is shown in the booking detail, where the contract \naccount is stated.\n\u2022The relation clearing is created in contract and on some  types of customer account only. By linking the debit (e.g. premi um invoice) \nto the credit (e.g. payment or premium refund) booking, this re lation type is used to document the balancing of the business  \naccounts in detail.

If the contract account is credited, ABS searches all open debit transactions. Debit movements are ordered by d ue date and \ninvoice type. Older premium invoices have a higher priority  than a payment slip fee with the same due date.\u00a0\nThe following rules apply:\n1. All premium-related bookings on the contract account are s ubject to clearing\n2. Premium and payment transactions are sorted by due dat e; the oldest open \nbooking clears first\n3. Automatic clearing uses a sequential clearing order. Premi ums are cleared first. \nDue fees are cleared second. Then, not yet due premiums. At l ast, not yet due fees \n(e.g.: annual fees) are cleared\n\u00a0\nIn general, contract clearing is about matching payments to in voices and vice-versa. However, it is possible to configure A BS in such a \nway that the contract clearing is enabled to match invoice s on class level with payments and vice-versa. In order  to understand this, it is \nimportant to remember that the invoice in ABS is detai led by the booking basis add-on. The booking basis add-on s hows invoice details \non class and on amount type levels.\nIn the majority of cases, the insurance product is bundled to  suit market practice. That means, for example, that the Jan uary invoice \nfor a certain motor vehicle insurance contract contains the  cover for any liability and the cover in case of passenger  accident. Both \nclasses might also be subject to taxes or surcharges, which ad d up to the total January invoice. If clearing on class leve l applies, a \npartial payment ought to be linked to a certain class first  (ideally covering the risk, the tax and the surcharges t hat are documented in \nthe booking basis add-on).

Such exchanges use specific data carriers, which are, in turn, interpr eted by \ncustomer-specific modules. Customer-specific modules place each tran saction into the ABS core payment interface. Then, the ABS  \ncore searches for the relevant business account and the ori ginal transfer. Bank transfer returns usually belong to faile d claim payments \nor premium refunds. Once the batch run places the bank transfer return to the business account, the account balance is updated. Th e \nbatch run also creates a process slip to inform the clerk abo ut the failed claim payment.

However, amounts below a certain threshold are not debited. ABS Core groups and collects \nthem with the next premium invoice instead.

O nce a payment covers the total amount of the outstanding pr emium, the coverage \nflag is reset to \u201cyes\u201d. The coverage flag and the date tha t goes with it are very important: they are checked by th e claim component to \nverify premium-based coverage.\nCustomer information\nThe customer information batch creates accompanying letters fo r the policies.

The ABS general ledger interface houses most bookings. Exceptions \nare the ones relating to coinsurance and funds transaction s \u2013 these have their own interfaces. Starting from the gen eral ledger, \ncustomers read and classify financial transactions as busine ss events (e.g.: premium invoicing, premium cancellation, commissi on \nincrease). Those business events are enriched with a cert ain set of dimensions, such as insurance class and risk coun try. They are \naggregated in general ledger, posted to the balance sheet an d to the profit & loss accounts (e.g. direct written premium).\nBooking and transfer work lists\nThe booking work list documents the bookings done to busine ss accounts during the course of a day. ABS summarizes automat ic \nbookings. It also displays manual bookings individually, orga nizing them by their booking voucher.

The sum insured of \nthe term life decreases on a linear basis and has no d irect \nrelationship with the paybacks on the loan. So the amount s \nmay drift apart.

The main idea of an annuity is to cr eate after a deferment period regular payments for a \npredefined benefit period.\u00a0\nIt is also possible to gather the cash value at maturity but due to the characteristics of an annuity this is not th e preferred variant. An\u00a0annuity \ninsurance is an appropriate financial product for those lookin g for a secure retirement income.\nConsequently,\u00a0annuity insurances\u00a0can be purchased to provide a n income during retirement. The payment stream from the i nsurer to the \nbeneficiary has a predefined (fixed benefit period) or unknow n duration (life long benefit period),\u00a0conditional on the d ate of death of the \ninsured person. At this point,\u00a0the contract will terminate  and\u00a0the remainder of the accumulated\u00a0cash value\u00a0is\u00a0forfeite d unless there is a \nguarantee period or a refund to the beneficiaries agreed.\nInsurance companies might offer several variations of annuity insuran ces. Among those variations are:\n\u2022Immediate annuities:  The annuity payments are paid \nimmediately arrears, for example, after the first month o f \nthe contract inception. This leads to an immediate income  \nafter a short period of time. Such annuity agreements are \nusually utilized after retirements, where a policyholder e nters \na contractual agreement by paying a lump-sum to secure a \nfixed income for the rest of his life.\n\u2022Deferred annuities:  In these cases, the annuity payments \nare paid out after a certain savings period where the capit al \naccumulation occurs. This type of annuity contract is \ntypically used as a retirement arrangement and planned \nmany years upfront to secure a fixed income after a certain \nage.\u2022Surrender Value or Premium Refund:  In case of demise \nduring the deferment period, the cash value of the paid \npremiums will be refunded to the beneficiaries. Lifelong or \ntemporary annuity payment: Depending on the terms and \nconditions of the annuity insurance, a lifelong or a tempora ry \npayment stream for a fixed period can be stipulated at the \nmaturity of the contract.\n\u2022Guarantee period in the case of a Claim: If a insured person \ndies during an agreed guaranteed period for the annuity \n(e.g. 15 years), the beneficiaries will receive the outstand ing \nannuities for the rest of the period.\n\u2022Regular  level premium and single premium payments.\nLet us look into an example:\n\uf0ebConrad\u00a0approaches Janet\u00a0and inquires about\u00a0suitable insurance s. \nConrad\u00a0is planning for his retirement and wishes to ha ve a guaranteed \nannuity for 15 years.\u00a0In this case,\u00a0the most suitable arra ngement \nincludes an annuity insurance with a\u00a0guarantee\u00a0period in cas e of\u00a0a\u00a0claim. \nTherefore, Janet advised Conrad\u00a0to\u00a0acquire an annuity in surance with \na guarantee period in the case of\u00a0a\u00a0claim for the period of 15 years. If \nConrad\u00a0dies before the completion of such\u00a0a\u00a0period, for exampl e after 10 \nyears, his beneficiaries will collect the remaining contract ed years.\nAn\u00a0annuity insurance is suitable as a retirement arrangem ent\u00a0and to secure a retirement income.

Th ese \ncalculations take into account a manifold of variables to mo del the \nunderlying risks and provide a commensurate insurance premi um \nfor the risks to be insured.\nFor example, a traditional life insurance typically insures  a person \nagainst a premature death. To properly calculate the risk of demise, \nthe rating engine needs input from ABS regarding the age, th e \nsmoking habits, occupation and dangerous hobbies of the insured \nperson as well as the duration and the sum insured of th e Life \ncontract. All these variables help to produce an adequate ri sk \npremium for the insurer.\nThe life file itself lacks a pricing-relevant logic, as the m athematical \ncalculations are customer-specific for each product and thus \nalways relayed to an external rating engine. As such, the  Life file \nallows for the integration of a customer-specific\u00a0Rating Engin e.\nThe\u00a0 Rating Engine\u00a0 uses the defined insurance rate to perfor m a \nseries of mathematical operations and mathematical vali dations \nrelevant for the day-to-day of selling and managing insur ance \npolicies.Among the validations performed by a customer-specific\u00a0 Rating \nEngine\u00a0is the validation of rate-specific limit values (e.g. minimum \nsum, entry age of the insured person, insurance duration) and  \nsometimes (if no risk assessment tool is used) the de termination \nof\u00a0 sport, health and occupational risk surcharges (or sometim es \ndiscounts). The\u00a0 Rating Engine\u00a0 can also check the inventory data \nfor pricing-relevant minimum input (e.g. smoker status or high risk \nsports).\nThe rating engine plays a significant role in the Life file and, as \naforementioned, there is no\u00a0pricing relevant logic in the file itself.\u00a0It \nis called and invoked at defined points in the Life file, such as:\nIntegrated interface for calling the customer-specific rating \nengine:\n\u2022Manual call with the calculation button from the menu bar.\n\u2022Manual call with the target calculator icon from the menu \nbar.Process-depending calls through the business logic of the \nLife file:\n\u2022While selecting amendment reasons (contract surrogate \npopup): \"G08 - Cancellation\", \"G17 - Premium Waiver\"\n\u2022While saving the contract\n\u2022While selecting a rate class\n\u2022While selecting certain side-tabs for the first time\nThe following figure shows the calculation button and target ca lculator icon from the menu bar, which trigger the manual calls  of the \nrating engine:", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2709, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0da13f1-a7dd-4063-a6ae-c43bebc4acd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0da13f1-a7dd-4063-a6ae-c43bebc4acd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "383", "file_name": "ABS_Prof_Full.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fdb45152-0286-460e-8ae3-1387ca832582", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "383", "file_name": "ABS_Prof_Full.pdf"}, "hash": "3a22e9d8498127ca58334fbe49f3852db85afa11f5605073bad6e13b2fe4bffc"}}, "hash": "3a22e9d8498127ca58334fbe49f3852db85afa11f5605073bad6e13b2fe4bffc", "text": "!It is important to emphasize \nthat the rating engine is always \ncustomer specific!\nThe following tasks are only for completeness in order to clarif y the role of the rating engine in the Life file:\n1.

The insurance company pays out the sum insured and the \nearned interest with a share of the profits (bonuses) at  the end of the contract.\nWhat is the surrender value, and in which insurances is it typically offered?\u00a0\nIt is the amount the policyholder will get from the Life i nsurance company, if he decides to exit the policy before matur ity.

Usually, this is done in case of a prol ongation of the employment and thus delay of the retirem ent.\nPlease name at least two examples of Fixed Term Insurances?\nWedding, child birth.\nPlease describe the Dread Disease Insurance.\u00a0\nA Dread Disease insurance guarantees fringe benefits for case s of life-threatening illness during the agreed contractual period. \nInsurance companies define life-threatening illnesses differ ently.

An Accidental Disability insurance gua rantees an additional benefit payment in case of disabili ty related to an \naccident during the period agreed in the contract. Both benefi t payments apply for the insured person.\nWhat is a waiver of premium or premium-free coverage?\u00a0\nFor example, in the case of a disability, the premium paymen t for a coverage can be waived. As a consequence, the insurer will finance \nthe remaining premiums for a Life insurance. To that end, at the maturity of the contract, the insured person will recei ve the benefit \npayment in full.\nWhy does ABS provide a separate Life file?\u00a0\nThe Life file functions as an extension to the general cont ract file.

To th at end, \nthe actual principle refers to the fact that the buy and sale process is \ninvoked only when the premium is \"actually\" paid by the customer  \nand collected by the insurer.  As a result, only after the clearing of \nthe booking, the fund purchasing process commences according \nto the latest fund price in the system.

In contrast to the actual principle, the target principle \ninitiates the fund purchasing with the creation of the booking  (e.g. \nsubsequent premium batch), where the clearing is decoupled from \nthe collection of the premium.

For example, this feature can be \nused if a customer wants to shift his investments from an  \nunderperforming fund to a better performing fund. The involved \nfund transactions will then be processed in the batch (see \nbelow).\nChange of fund allocations During contract amendments, the fund allocations can be \nchanged manually by a clerk. For example, a fund contract has \ntwo funds insured (fund A, fund B) with an allocation of 50% \nand 50%, respectively, for each fund. The customer requests a \nchange with new allocations for fund A (20%) and fund B (80%) . \nAs a result, starting with the next invoicing period, 20% o f the \npremium payments will be invested in fund A and 80% in fund B.\nAdditional contributions for funds Besides the regular (recurring) premium payments, a customer \nmight want to top up his fund contract with an additional \npayment. For example, a customer has received tax refund \nof EUR 1000 and wants to save and invest this amount i n \nfunds. Consequently, the customer requests an additional \ncontribution of EUR 1000 on his fund contract.

For example, a fund basket has 20 \nindividual funds defined in the defining data. To specify whi ch of \nthese individual funds should be made available for invest ments \nand thus shown on a contract, an administrator must first  \nestablish the composition of the fund basket. Among the 20 \navailable funds, the administrator chooses three individ ual funds \n(e.g. fund A, B and C) to determine the fund basket structure. \nAfter determining this composition, all contracts that incl ude this \nfund basket will invest into these three individual funds  under the \nfund basket. The structure of the fund basket can be changed \nat any point in time by an administrator that has perm issions in \nthe person file under the top-tab \u201cFunds\u201d and side-tab \u201cFun ds \nbasket\u201d.\nFund distributions ABS also allows the administration of dividend distr ibutions for \nfunds in the person file for an asset management company. \nCertain funds will yield dividends which can then be furth er \ninvested into funds in ABS. In order to determine the dividend \ndistribution for a fund, an administrator has to document \nthe distribution information (date, amount and status) in  the \nrespective side-tab \u201cDistribution\u201d under the top-tab \u201cFunds\u201d  in the \nperson file.

In contrast to the \nfund purchase operations, fund sales will involve the claim \nbatches, as pay-outs are always administered in the claim  \nprocessing in ABS. For this, a claim will be automatically cr eated \nin the Life contract file via the claims integration function  during \na fund withdrawal or cancellation.

These will be \ndescribed next.\nRestructuring of funds on a contract (fund baskets) Whenever the structure of a fund basket is changed by an \nadministrator, all contracts that include this fund basket must \nbe adapted as well. For example, the composition of a fund \nbasket with two individual funds A and B is changed to fund s A \nand C. As a consequence, all fund shares from fund B must be \nredistributed to the new funds basket structure involving fund s \nA and C. This restructuring is ensured by a specific fund batch in  \nABS.\nRestructuring of funds on a contract (objection period) An objection period relates to legal regulations in which a policy \nholder has a right of cancellation within a certain time  period, for \nexample within 14 days of signing the unit-linked Life cont ract. \nFor that reason, fund shares should not be bought right away , \nbut rather after this objection period in order to minimi ze the \ninherent price risks for the insurer. For example, if a custo mer \ncancels his contract within the legal objection period, all paid \npremiums have to be rebooked and returned to the customer. As \na result, in case of a direct fund investment, the funds need  to \nbe sold by the insurer and there would be no guarantee tha t the \nfund value is commensurate to the paid premium. This poses \na price risk for the insurer, as the value of the funds could drop \nwithin this period. In order to reduce these price fluctuatio n \nrisks, ABS can circumvent a direct investment of an incomin g \npremium through parking the money in a \u201cpark fund\u201d for the \nduration of the objection period. As a result, after the obje ction \nperiod is over and assuming that the policy holder did n ot \nemploy his right to cancel, the reallocation from the park fund to \nthe selected funds on the contract is automatically triggere d by \na batch program in ABS.\nRestructuring of funds on a contract (expiration management) In ABS, the automatic expiration management is triggered be fore \nthe end date of a fund contract in order to protect the col lected \ninvestment portfolio against any losses. For this, higher  risk \nfunds are automatically reallocated to low risk funds in a  defined \nperiod, so that on expiration of the contract, only low ri sk fund \nshares are present.\nRestructuring of funds on a contract (guaranteed values) Depending on the guaranteed value of the contract, automatic \nfund shifts will ensure that the overall value of the fund portfolio \ndoes not undershoot a predefined threshold. For this, fund  shifts \nwill be carried out from the regular fund class to the guarant eed \nvalue fund class.\nRestructuring of funds on a contract (fund closure) In case a fund needs to be closed, ABS provides a batch \nprocedure that triggers a fund shift from the closed fund to \na target fund on all respective unit-linked Life contracts. Fo r \nexample, an administrator wants to close fund A. For this , he \nneeds to create a batch file depicting all relevant contract s, the \nclosed fund A and the target funds for the shifts.

These administration costs can be deducted from \neach fund contract by selling a certain percentage of the \navailable fund shares with the proceeds compensating the \nadministration costs for the insurer. The costing rules for  the \nfunds management are customer-specific.\n\uf19d Knowledge Check\nDefine a standard Unit-linked Life insurance?\u00a0\nUnit-linked Life insurance (standard): in the standard ve rsion, the unit-linked Life product will consist of a leadin g class with a traditional \nLife insurance and one or several fund classes.

For example, this feature can be used if a customer wa nts to shift \nhis investments from an underperforming fund to a better per forming fund.\nWhat are the two main principles of funds management in terms of fund purchasing?\nActual and Target Principle. The actual principle refers to the  fact that the buy and sale process is invoked only when the premium \nis \"actually\" paid by the customer and collected by the insur er. As a result, only after the clearing of the booking, the fund purchasing \nprocess will take part.\nIn the target principle the fund purchases are initiated wit h the creation of the booking (i.e. in the policy processing).

But there are some \nimplementations also in Non-Life. The key point is \nwhen a contract amendment is the trigger for the \nclaim creation, the claim integration eases the whole \nprocess. So also in Life there are claims which are \ncreated directly in the claims file and not through the \nclaim integration.\nThe creation of a claim in a Life contract usually involves \ntwo steps and processes:\n1. First, the Life contract has to be amended (cancelation, \nsurplus withdrawals, partial surrenders, etc.).\n2. Second, a claim has to be created.This two-step procedure necessitated a simplification for th e \nclaim processing in Life.

For \nexample, a person's account manager will also be preset as \ncontract manager upon creation of a new contract for this pers on. \nThe contract manager, in turn, will typically be set as commi ssion \nagent for the contract's coverages.\n\u00a0The three agent roles described above are related to th eir activities \nregarding customer care on person and contract level. An agen t can, \nhowever, also support other agents in the role of agent ma nager. \nThis can, for example be an agent's line manger or a senior  agent \ntraining and supporting a new agent. It is also possible to define \nagent managers on commission account level, if this granulari ty is \nrequired (details on commission accounts will be provided further \nbelow).\nIt is, however, also possible that some of a customer's cont racts are managed by a different agent than the account mana ger. This can, \nfor example, be the case when the account manager is responsi ble for all the customers non-life contracts, but a different s pecialist is \ncontract manager for the life contract. In this case, the accoun t manager is responsible for the overall care of the custom er, fundamentally \nincluding the life contract. For more specific questions regardi ng the life contract, however, the contract's manager will be responsible. \nThe exact balance between these two roles will depend on  the specific situation. In ABS, neither account manager nor co ntract manager \nwill directly receive commission for having these roles.

While this number is also known as the agent  \nnumber, please note that frequently an agent will have mor e than \none commission account and, thus, several agent numbers.Agents cannot perform their tasks unless they have at le ast \none commission account. There, all settings of interest are  \nmaintained, such as the allocation in the sales structure, a \nlink to the terms for commission (the so-called commiss ion \nscheme), currency, month of due date, and payment frequency \nand channel. Often, agents will need more than one commis sion \naccount; for example if they are working for more than one \nagency, obtain different commission rates (mapped to different  \ncommission schemes), receive commission for contracts in \ndifferent currencies, or require different payment settings.\u00a0\n!A commission account is a necessary precondition for the entitleme nt to commission. So commission \ncalculation and commission bookings are only possible for agents with  commission account.\n\u2022All bookings for every commission account can be queried in \nthe form of a list.\n\u2022Commission overview and account overview offer another \nform of querying.\u2022The functionality for printing commission account \nstatements (so called \"commission notes\") and tax auth ority \nconfirmations can also be provided for the commission \naccount.\nCommission Account Specifics\n\u2022There is a function available for commission account, which \nallows to rebook to other accounts.

Two options \nare the use of automatic commission splitting or super \ncommission, respectively. The settings for both are defined \non commission account level, and they mainly differ in two  \naspects: whether the commission earned by the agent of \ninterest will be reduced by the remuneration for the mana ger, \nand whether the other agents are identified individual ly, or \nbased on hierarchy level.\n\u2022Automatic commission splitting: for the agent's commission \naccount, one or more settings for automatic commission \nsplitting can be defined in favor of named managers.

Some  \nexamples are policy processing, value adjustments, subsequent \ninvoicing, etc.\nA special use case for batch printing are documents that are cr eated \nby letter writing or online printing, where the user sele cts \"central \nprint\" (rather than printing the document on a local print er, or \nsending it via e-mail). A scheduled batch task is created in that case, \nthat is then handled by batch.\n\uf0ebExamples of such automatically generated \ndocuments are: policy documents, account \nstatements, tax authority confirmations, insurer \nchanges, etc.\nBatch printing is highly customer-specific and therefore not pr ovided in ABS Core. Every insurance company has its own particular \nprinting needs which guides its decision regarding which docum ent generation\u00a0system to use. As such, customers need to im plement \ntheir own document creation batch jobs.

Master contract \nconfiguration attributes can be defined for each level. A maste r \ncontract with package\u00a0serves as a basis for creating and \nmanaging large numbers of individual contracts. It can be \nincorporated into a contract hierarchy to represent the co mpany \nhierarchy.\n2. Open policy with package (contract type GG)\nOpen policy with package\u00a0is a group business contract type, mainly  short term, used for complex and highly flexible agreements  with an \nindividual business partner. It is usually provided to seve ral business partners for the sale to individual customers  (e.g. travel agents). \nReusability and sales control for each business partner are  in the main focus of\u00a0this contract type.\nIn the group business file, for contracts with this contract ty pe, the levels of\u00a0tariff model,\u00a0object class\u00a0and product package\u00a0ca n also be \nused.\nCompared to a\u00a0master contract with package, an open policy wi th package\u00a0cannot be a basis for creating an individual contra ct. For this \nreason, non-recurring settlements can be created and policy- processed.
